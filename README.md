## Overview
The goal of the project is to use data analytics to improve retailer (national grocery chain named Regork) efficiency in purchasing and marketing by means of better understanding customer habits and establishing a long-term relationship with them. We are analyzing the data from the Complete Journey Dataset. With this dataset, the question that we want to find an answer to is which customer is buying what types of products and from which department, as well as the demographics (age group) the customer belong, to better understand their shopping trends and improve sales.

We can use transaction and customer data to find important and useful insights which can help the business grow and improve its strategies. It can be used to answer questions like:

- What departments are bringing the most and least sales?
- What is the general trend of age group spending?
- Which demographic group is spending more on which department products?
- How many coupons are redeemed by customers based on the department?

## Packages used
- Knitr: Used to display an aligned table on the screen
- Tidyverse: Used to tidy data
- Lubridate: Used to manipulate date-time
- Treemap: Visualize hierarchical data using nested rectangles
- Dplyr: Used for data manipulation
- Ggplot2: Used to plot charts
- Plotly: Used to plot interactive charts

## Analysis

### Sales Analysis

We employed a tree map plot to illustrate the quantitative correlation between various age groups and their cumulative sales values. The darker palette in the tree map plot indicates higher total sales values for specific age groups. Based on our analysis, the 19-24 age group exhibits a lighter palette scheme, signifying a comparatively lower contribution to the total sales value compared to other age groups.

The above graph shows a column bar plot for three departments showing the total sales value per age group.

### Department Analysis

Based on the earlier observations, we delved deeper and selectively analyzed three age groups—19-24, 55-64, and 65+—due to their nearly identical household counts. Consequently, a column bar plot was generated to visualize the distinctions. Despite the comparable household counts across these age groups, it is evident that the 19-24 age group contributes less to the three departments compared to the other two. As a result, we can infer that the 19-24 age group tends to make fewer purchases from these three departments.

### Coupon Analysis

The graph presented above is generated by utilizing data from coupons, coupon redemptions, product, and demographic tables to populate information for the Nutrition, Pastry, and Deli departments. This visual representation illustrates the count of redeemed coupons categorized by age groups. Within each age group, the analysis focuses on the top five UPC codes of coupons that are currently being redeemed.

## Summary
The following is the summary of the analysis:

1. The sales for demographic (age-group) 19-24 has the least sales and 45-54 has the most sales.
2. The age-groups 19-24, 55-64 & 65+ had nearly the same household counts and hence when we compared their sales for a few departments we got to know that 19-24 demographic group consumes less nutrition.
3. The departments Nutrition, Deli and Pastry where the contribution to total sales value from each age group was having comparable quantities and when compared Nutrition was consumed less by age group 19-24.
4. The coupons distributed within various departments gave us an insight that the GROCERY department has redeemed most coupons whereas the PHOTO & VIDEO was the least.
5. The Top 5 coupons redeemed for departments Nutrition, Deli and Pastry in each age group signify that 19-24 demographic group also redeemed fewer coupons for those departments.

In short, our goal was to analyze the sales for different age groups and extract insights to help Regork business grow by providing more coupons for departments that are having fewer sales, in this case, NUTRITION, and create awareness about how nutrition is more important in our daily life with the help of marketing team, this will allow Regork to increase sales for those age groups and generate more revenue.
